## Usage

```workflow
workflow "Deploy on sanity.studio" {
  on = "push"
  resolves = ["deploy"]
}

action "deploy" {
  uses = "docker://kmelve/github-actions-sanity-io"
  secrets = [
    "SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN",
  ]
}

action "deploy" {
  needs = ["deploy"]
  uses = "docker://kmelve/github-actions-sanity-io"
  args = "sanity deploy"
  secrets = [
    "SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN",
  ]
}
```

### Secrets
